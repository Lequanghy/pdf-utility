[build]
  # The command that builds your SvelteKit app
  command = "npm run build"     # or "yarn build" / "pnpm build" if you use those

  # The folder Netlify should serve as the published site
  publish = "build"             # Default output folder from adapter-static

  # Optional: Environment variables (if needed for Node version or other settings)
  # environment = { NODE_VERSION = "22" }   # Uncomment and adjust if you need a specific Node version

# Critical for SPA / client-side routing (prevents 404 on refresh / direct links)
